# Derrating App - Swift Project

## Overview

This Swift-based project is the culmination of my college studies in Electrical Engineering at Universidade Federal de UberlÃ¢ndoa (UFU), presented as the conclusion work to obtain my diploma. The project focuses on developing a specialized calculator for power transformers. The calculator receives essential information such as rated data, load current, and harmonic currents, aiming to determine the ideal operating current in per unit (pu) to preserve the transformer's lifespan.

## Features

- **Transformer Information Input:** Input critical details about the power transformer, including its rated data, load current, and harmonic currents to calculate the ideal operating current in per unit (pu) that ensures the preservation of the power transformer's lifespan.

- **Lifespan Preservation Calculation:** Provide 3 methods of calculation of the estimated transformer's lifespan in hours. 

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Benefit from an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction with the calculator.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift Programming Language:** The application is developed using Swift, a versatile and powerful programming language for iOS app development.

- **UIKit Framework:** Leveraging the UIKit framework to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
